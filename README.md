# Weather App

A simple weather application built as part of **The Odin Project** using **vanilla JavaScript**, **Open-Meteo**, **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim)**, and **Weather Icons**.

Users can search for any city, fetch current weather conditions, and view them with icons, dynamic backgrounds, and temperature unit toggling.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Open-Meteo API (no API key required)
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- Weather Icons CDN


## What I Learned
- How to work with multiple APIs in a single app
- Parsing and cleaning API JSON into usable objects
- DOM manipulation to generate UI components dynamically
- CSS animation (spinning loader icon)
- Mapping complex data structures (Open-Meteo weather codes)
- Using Nominatim's `display_name` for clean City, Country formatting


## Optional Improvements
Since this was a learning project, the weather data is intentionally kept simple.

Possible future additions:
- Add hourly or 7-day forecast
- Add humidity, sunrise/sunset, low/high temperature
- Improve UI responsiveness
- Allow pinning a default location

## Notes
This project is focused on clean, readable vanilla JavaScript rather than frameworks.
